# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure User Terraform Module

This [Terraform module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) allows an [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure  user](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingusers.htm) to be used in either read-only mode or read/write mode. You can switch between the two modes by setting `user_create` to either true (read/write) or false (read-only).

```hcl
module "iam_user1" {
  source           = "../modules/iam-user"
  tenancy_ocid     = "${var.tenancy_ocid}"
  user_name        = "tf_example_user1@oracle.com"
  user_description = "user1 created by terraform"
}
```

Note the following parameters:

Argument | Description
--- | ---
tenancy_ocid | (Required) Unique identifier (OCID) of the tenancy.
user_name | The name you assign to the user during creation. The name must be unique across all compartments in the tenancy.
user_description | (Required if user_create is true.) Description of the user. The description is editable.
user_create | (Optional) Specifies whether the module should create a user. If true, the user must have permissions to create a user. If false, user data will be returned about existing users. If no users are found, an empty string is returned for the user ID. Default value is true.

You can find the other parameters in [variables.tf](https://github.com/oracle-terraform-modules/terraform-oci-iam/blob/master/modules/iam-user/variables.tf).
