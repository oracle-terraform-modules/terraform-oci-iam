/*
 * This example shows how to reference an existing compartment as a resource (compartment_create = false),
 * or if a compartment needs to be created, please set compartment_create = true.
 * Also this example shows how to create two users, a group and add two users to it, and create a policy
 * pertaining to a compartment and group.
 * And some more directives to show dynamic groups and policy for it.
 *
 * Note: the compartment resource internally resolves name collisions and returns a reference to the preexisting
 * compartment. Compartments can not be deleted, so removing a compartment resource from your .tf file will only
 * remove it from your statefile. User, group and dynamic group created by this example can be deleted by using
 * terrafrom destroy.
